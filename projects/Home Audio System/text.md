> Teaching a machine how to DJ autonomously. Consists of a metadata application and a live mixing application.

The metadata application is used to set required metadata such as beats per minute (BPM) or interesting sections in the music. Based on the metadata the live mixing application tries to find matching music and mixes songs together (performing transitions etc.). The manual process of adding metadata may be replaced by algorithms in the future.
